This results in a performance boost as there is no need to rebuild the schema, import a backup SQL dump or re-insert fixtures before every testcase.</p>\n<p>It also speeds up EntityManager data and query cache with included <code>Psr6StaticArrayCache</code>. This is especially beneficial if you have a lot of tests that boot kernels (like Controller tests or ContainerAware tests) and use Doctrine entities.</p>\n",
